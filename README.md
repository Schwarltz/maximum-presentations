# Maximum Attendable Presentations

An interview question that I couldn't answer in time.

## Task

A presentation occurs for n hours and has a starting time and ending time.

A person can attend only one presentation at a given hour. 

There is no delay between changing to another presentation.

Given 2 0-indexed arrays scheduleStart and scheduleEnd which 
represents a presentation as an index, determine the maximum 
number of presentations a person can attend.
